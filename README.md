# HCI-Group-Project
A Group project which involved creating a Web/Modile/Windows application called Cougar Advisor.

The Cougar Advisor application basically helps students and instructors manage their classes effectively. We created three different applications on 3 different platforms: mobile, windows and web.

I worked on the web application which was created in Visual Studio 2013 using C# and ASP.NET.

NOTE: Only the web application code is included since that was the portion I worked on. The project won't run because I don't have access to the database anymore but you can still review the webforms I created in the implemention folder.
